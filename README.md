## ðŸ“‹ About this repo
This repo is built on Nextjs's architecture. We mainly work on these folders (There will be update if there is anything changes)
### 1. app
- This folder contains the main program
### 2. components
- This folder contains components which are downloaded from Shadcn UI, and our's custom components
- Every component should be named in PascalCase. For example: SignInButton, SideBar,...
### 3. lib
- Including functions, constant varibles, etc. that are relevant to the program. This can be anything. For example: getList(), getUser(),... anything you want that help you implement features.
### 4. public
- Including static file, such as image, logo, video, etc.
### 5. docs
- Holding documents about feature's workflows, many screens that a feature needs. This folder will be updated often.
